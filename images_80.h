#ifndef MATRIX_IMAGES_H
#define MATRIX_IMAGES_H

/* Image data for 3D images and credits. Each set of 6300 characters represents
 * Z values for each of the 90*70 on-screen characters.
 *
 * Tips for creating a new image:
 *    - Z-values must be in the range 0-255, higher numbers being further back
 *    - In the GIMP, if you set an image to indexed mode, scale it to 90x70
 *    pixels and export to a .h file, the header_data[] array will contain the
 *    Z-values. Setting to grayscale may be required.
 *    - The image should smoothly merge to 0's at the left/right edges, so that
 *    it works with the widescreen additions. In the GIMP, inverting an image
 *    could help with this.
 *    - Most photos/images will translate extremely poorly, because of the low
 *    resolution. The images below were very extensively modified before being
 *    exported, and most images just don't work.
 *
 * To add a new image (without messing up the credits):
 *    - Add the new data just BEFORE the first credit image (search for #C1)
 *    - Increment num_pics in src/matrix.c
 *
 *  If you make something cool, send a patch to <vincent@doublecreations.com>!
